The program takes one argument: the path of a file with the '.ber' extension, which contains a map description.

If you want to launch it, you can give any of the file in the 'maps' and 'debug_maps' directories as argument (knowing that the debug_maps/err_\*.ber files should cause an error because of their bad format).
